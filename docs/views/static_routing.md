# Static Routing
## Introduction
Denoot makes it easy to statically serve files from a given folder. This means that Denoot will look inside a folder and try to match it with the URL. This feature is meant to be used when you need to serve responses that aren't dynamically generated by your app. A very common use case is serving website assets such ass css, js, images etc.
## Examples
Here `/public` will act as an alias to the local folder `static`. If provided `options.folder` is relative, the root wil be from where you started your deno app.
```ts
app.static("/public", {
    folder: "static"
});
```
Enable auto indexing. Providing `options.autoIndex` as `true` will tell Denoot to create a directory index if the given URL resolves to a __directory__.
```ts
app.static("/public", {
    folder: "static",
    autoIndex: true
});
```
Enable index files. If you want Denoot to look for an index file upon resolving to a directory, set `options.index` to your file extension for example: `.html` where `index.html` will be served if found inside the directory.
```ts
app.static("/public", {
    folder: "static",
    index: ".html"
});
```

__Note:__ By default Denoot will **not** allow [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) to be served or displayed in auto index. If you absolutely, 100% know what you're doing you can change this behavior by setting `res.state.allowDotFiles` to `true`.
